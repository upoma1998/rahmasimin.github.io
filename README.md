## Research Experience

ReTSoSPA: IoT-based Real Time Soil Sensing for Precision Agriculture (2025)
Rahma Simin Ali, Dr. Asaduzzaman

Published to 2024 27th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT).

We have developed a real time dataset from field level by establishing an IoT soil sensing hardware system with 5 sensors. The soil data collected from sensors are sent from a transmitter node to a receiver node and stored in the Cloud server through WiFi. We have trained several  Machine Learning algorithms for prediction of crops- potato, tomato, and three classes of rice that consist of the 61 types of rice produced in Bangladesh at different times of the year. Based on the predicted crop, the optimal amount of fertilizer like Urea, TSP and MoP is recommended. Finally, we have built a [Web Application](https://upoma1998-iotfin1-app-upoma1-umt8y3.streamlit.app/) to help farmers monitor soil conditions remotely for real time prediction.
